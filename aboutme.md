Like many people, after highschool I enrolled a faculty without knowing it quite meant. For me I it was the Faculty of Mechanical Engieering and Naval Architecture. I was good at maths and phyiscs in highschool, machines interested me and sure enough mechanical engineering seemed like a good idea. Although I studied and was at the top of my clas for the two years I've spent there I felt a great dissatisfaction with what mechanical engieering really meant. So I quit.
